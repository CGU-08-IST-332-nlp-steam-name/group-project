Although many boss fights are repetitive and just boring after first 2/3 hours. Godskins, Crucible Knights, Erdtree Avatars, Tree Sentinels, Draconic Tree Sentinels, Ulcerated Tree Spirit and every single dragon fight with exception of like 2/3 dragons and couple others. Just boring to be honest.
Locations.
Expecting every cave/castle to be unique in such a big open world would be stupid hence I hope fromsoftware in their future games sticks to more linear approach from Dark Souls series - linear with an illusion of an open world. Then we can expect high quality in these locations because unfortunately Elden Ring dropped in quality compared to previous games. Sure, someone might point out that Liurnia looks cool from the hill behind Stormveil castle but the question is - is there anything worth checking? Does any of these location offer antyhing but looks? Randomly spawned lobsters remind kind of dragon asses from Lost Izalith - their purpose was to just fill the empty space and artificially extend the location.
Just too much of an emptiness.


Still - even though there is some criticism from my side I still love the game. Sure, I think some bosses are complete opposite of what FS used to make - waterflow dance being complete bs mechanic after all of these years. Input reading - this thing I hope does not make it into their future games.

When it comes to the DLC - the emptiness of some location is also visible but due to the nature of what DLCs are we can easily just ignore and overall it is not that big of an issue compared to the base game.

High Quality content and easily can recommend - There is few bs mechanics in DLC but still - great game.

209631000,76561197997349330,7175,7175,0,1723982184,"This review is a bunch of nitpicking but the more I play the older From games the more I'm disappointed with this game:

The open world itself is forgettable since it poses zero challenge to the player.  You can just turn your brain off and run past every enemy with zero punishment. People still reminisce about their first time in Blight Town or facing those two guys down the well in Bloodborne. There is literally nothing of sort in Elden Ring.

The small dungeons spread out in the open world sometimes have interesting gimmicks but usually end with you killing a reused boss and being rewarded something you'll never end up using. Bloodborne chalices had random layouts, a decent amount of  enemies/bosses not in the regular game and gave you a reason to do them in Blood gems. All that and most people still skipped them. Ubisoft level bloat for people who don't realize more playtime doesn't make a game better. 

Legacy dungeons, you don't even want to explore because after doing a few you realize the only decent content the game has are the bosses. DS1 was praised for the inteconnected world, DS2 and 3 still had shortcuts you could discover by exploring.  The level design once again devolved with ER, with a grace around every corner the shortcuts and the relief from finally finding one are mostly gone. 

Bosses, I've died to Malenia, Messmer and Radahn dozens of times yet none of them gave me the same dopamine hit from killing Gael or Orphan in maybe one fifth of the tries. It feels like 90% of the challenge with all these big bad bosses are their one or two crazy moves. You'll die over and over to Waterfowl or the big snake combo Messmer has until you figure out when and which way to roll or run. You'll never get that adrenaline rush from getting a boss to 5-10% your first try because these moves solely exist to make older players not whine about everything else by giving the illusion of difficulty while still letting the new ""broader audience"" tank half the combos with their summon. This contrast in difficulty between the world and the bosses also makes the game feel like a boss rush rather than an adventure like the older games.

Narrative, they don't leave things to imagination much compared to the older games. Ranni probably blogs more about the story than the entirety of DS1 dialogue. Around the same amount of NPC questlines in a much bigger world makes the world feel even more barren. Through 3 playthroughs I haven't noticed a Solaire, Lucatiel or Anri. Someone on a similar journey, living their own life you come across multiple times. Maybe they exist but the world isn't interesting enough for me to go find them.

Multiplayer, covenants are gone, invasions are opt-in. All the fun sucked out of it because god forbid the people who already look up everything online would have to look up how to turn invasions off too.

It's still an okay game but I'm worried where FromSoft is heading. I don't care if some guy who didn't have the dedication to beat the older games now gets to have fun beating bosses with spells/summons/weapon arts as long as it doesn't end up making the game a worse experience but the multiple steps backwards taken in level/world design, narrative, multiplayer are clearly an attempt to make the game more appealing to them, and it affects everyone.
Even the content people create has gone downhill, from meme videos, challenges and invasions to weapon/spell/x rankings, how to cheese x boss and loreslop (FUCK VAATI)",1763568827,1763569640,False,2,0,0.482819348573684692,True,False,False,Elden Ring

There is so much content and most of it doesn't seem to get old. This game has a show and don't tell form of storytelling.

The lore is extremely scattered and if you want to learn about one thing, you usually have to search for consistencies in dialogue from one NPC to another. Some NPCs will openly lie to you while others will border the line of insanity and coherency. It's up to you as the player to determine who's intel is reliable or not. 
Pros:
- Vast open world.
- Great combat mechanics. It's not the best I've ever seen, but it's the boss fights you play the game for.
- Deep lore rich story.
- Beautifully crafted environments.
- Good graphics.
- Extremely replayable with different build and story options.
Cons:
- The game needs a radial menu to select spells and items. Cycling through items is too inefficient.
- Lore is difficult to engage.

O, maidenless wretch, O, tarnished of no renown… sit awhile, and listen. I shall weave for you a tale of this land, not of its sorrows, but of its sublime glory.
Praise the Path, the blessed, harrowing road laid for us by Greater Will
From the gilded plains of Limgrave, where the Agheel soars and the very air hums with a promise of grace… to the scarlet bloom of Caelid, a beautiful, festering masterpiece of celestial betrayal! We have tread where the very stars have fallen, in the eternal city of Nokron, and felt the chilling awe of the Queen of the Full Moon's sorceries in her academy of stone and intellect.
And the battles! The glorious, soul-shattering trials! To stand before Starscourge Radahn, a demigod holding back the cosmos in his magnificent, rotting madness! To cross blades with Malenia, Blade of Miquella, she who has never known defeat, and to witness the bloom of the scarlet rot—a terrible, beautiful apocalypse!
Even in the depths, in the forsaken sewers and the blasphemous veins of the earth, we found purpose. For every fall, every death, was a lesson carved into our very spirit. Each defeat, a stepping stone to becoming more than we were.
So praise it all! The guidance of grace and the sting of the curse! The crucible of our suffering has forged us anew. We have gathered the shards, we have faced the fire, and we are made Lords.
Arise, ye Tarnished. The path is long, and every step is a verse in the grand epic of the Lands Between.
May grace guide you. Always.",1763511903,1763511903,True,0,0,0.5,True,False,False,Elden Ring

Regardless how difficult this game is.... Elden Ring is not ""a HARDCORE"" game for HARDCORE gamers; Because of that reason. I would say... I always go vanilla, without ZERO guides and so forth. In this manner Elden Ring was NOT a pleasant experience, because you might miss a LOT of stuff in your first playthrough. And obviously to understand the lore you HAVE TO check out some youtube video explaining all that stuff. 

And what's up with the ""Open World""-formula? It's empty and shallow, and sometimes even reminiscent of a Bethesda game like Oblivion, SkyRim, Fallout 3 or 4. Sure, the main difference between Elden Ring is that it does not entirely SUCK like a Bethesda game. It's got at least TWO AMAZING boss fights, but remember it's got loads of mini-boss fights that are just plain out repetition.

FromSoftware took everything they’ve learned over the years and built a world that rewards curiosity, patience, and experimentation more than any of their previous titles.

The combat is demanding but fair, giving you the freedom to approach encounters with whatever playstyle you gravitate toward. Heavy weapon bruiser, nimble bleed build, magic artillery, hybrid experiments — the game genuinely supports it all. Bosses hit hard, but they’re memorable fights that feel like puzzles you solve through mastery rather than luck. When you finally win, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.

Exploration is where Elden Ring truly shines. The open world feels handcrafted rather than procedural, packed with secrets, ruins, optional dungeons, and unexpected discoveries that make wandering off the beaten path irresistible. Even after dozens of hours, I kept stumbling into areas I had completely missed. It’s one of the few open worlds where exploration feels consistently meaningful.

The story is cryptic but rich, and while the narrative is presented in a minimalistic way, the atmosphere and environmental storytelling more than make up for it. The art direction, music, and overall sense of place create a world that’s as haunting as it is beautiful.

This is a game that respects your time, challenges your skill, and rewards your curiosity. If you enjoy action RPGs, deep combat systems, memorable boss design, or open-world exploration, Elden Ring remains one of the best experiences available.

209488789,76561198013325883,2511,2511,0,1761417753,"The most overrated game of all time.

Let me be clear: I don’t mind difficulty. In fact, I’ve loved challenging games since childhood. I enjoy learning from my mistakes, improving, dying, trying again, and beating bosses. I defeated 30–40 bosses in Elden Ring without giving up, raging, or complaining about the difficulty.

My issue is not difficulty, it’s everything else.

Story & Worldbuilding

Yes, the world of Elden Ring can be huge, rich, and deep. But a world that big shouldn’t be this vague. The “story” basically consists of a guy shouting at the beginning and a handful of cryptic NPCs who talk like they’re solving riddles. That’s simply not for me.

I want to engage with a story.
I want an actual script, a main quest that makes sense, something to pull me into the world.
I shouldn’t have to check item descriptions or chase random weird NPCs across a massive map just to understand the basics of the lore. (Lore of the world, not the story)

Some players enjoy that style and that’s completely fine, but I don’t.

Gameplay.....

This is where the game completely loses me.

Elden Ring still uses the same old formula from 2007: slow, clunky, roll–dodge–hit combat that becomes extremely repetitive after a while. After a masterpiece like Sekiro, I genuinely thought FromSoftware would push their combat systems forward. Instead, they went backward.

Sure, there are tons of builds and creative options. But at the end of the day, every boss fight ends up feeling like you're just a rolling Pokémon waiting for openings. It’s uninteresting and dull.

Visuals & Exploration

I’ll give credit where it’s due: visually and structurally, the world is stunning. I normally hate getting lost in video games, but Elden Ring’s worldbuilding makes exploration rewarding, every corner has something to discover, and that’s a huge positive.

But in the end, amazing exploration doesn’t mean much when:

1)The story gives you nothing to hold onto, and

2)The combat system feels boring and outdated.

Conclusion

I respect people who love this game, everyone has different tastes. But I genuinely cannot see the appeal. After 42 hours of boredom, I have to drop it midway.

There is still plenty of reused assets and repeated fights (and apparently some assets are from older souls games but idk about that). But still, game gave me a feeling similar to playing ocarina of time again.

The game is also quite replayable with how many different weapons and possible builds you can make BUTTTTT the game is so long that I find myself kinda dreading having to play it again for different endings or trying out different weapons. The weapon thing can be especially annoying since upgrading weapons costs a limited finite resource and if you upgrade a weapon there's no way to unupgrade it if you decide you actually want to change your build. Can sometimes make you feel like you are ""stuck"" with a certain build.
Also there's a good chance you've probably heard people wanting a ""difficulty slider"" and while I don't want that, it should be noted that certain builds are absolutely just easier than others. If you want to play this game on easy mode, use a dex-bleed or full magic build. (Which again this can kinda suck if you accidentally build your character to a build that is harder BUT that you find more fun.

I've played Dark Souls 1-3 and I think, comparatively, Elden Ring is just not a similar enough experience. 
Boss design feels too fast for responding to, leaving you to just gamble on dodging correctly or leaning into just blocking most of the fight. The attacks aren't big OR fast, they're big AND fast.
Navigating detracts from combat. I ended up just racing around with my horse and getting all of the possible waypoints around the map, which seems to be par for the course, but it felt like a waste of my time. Same for walking into a level 40 area at the start, grinding there for a while, and then coming back to all of the bosses dying in 4 hits. Not to mention mounted combat, which has been interesting in concept, and frustrating in practice.
Speaking of which, the balance is suboptimal. As a Strength Barbarian, I was fascinated by the stun/knockdown system, but it didn't feel rewarding because you have to keep attacking for so long back-to-back. This incentivized   just gambling on charged heavy attacks and being rewarded for the boss to by chance just use the worst attack on you. It felt gross. I bet other builds like Magic are a lot faster and feel better to play, but I definitely didn't play that build so that's moot to me.
So yeah, I can't really recommend it. I wish I could. The game just left me feeling pretty empty and regretful. I think FromSoftware made an okay game, I just don't think it can be justified to recommend others for spending the hours to beat it. If you do end up getting it though, maybe don't play a Strength build like I did.",1763277127,1763277127,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,True,False,False,Elden Ring

My only real criticism is that the oversized open world makes it a bit hard to know where you're supposed to go compared to their older games. That, and it can make finding important gear pieces for your intended build is a matter of pure luck, rather than knowing you'll eventually run into what you want.

My fears were not only met, but surpassed. I don’t foresee myself playing any new title from Fromsoft if they keep trying to take their aging combat system and continue to duct tape Devil May Cry bosses into it. My issues with this game are legion, but I’ll just list off the most poignant ones.

- Enemies can and WILL input read you, and retaliate with frame perfect precision.
- Enemies can and WILL be put around corners to deal cheap chip damage.
-Enemies can and WILL do combos that dole out multi hit flurries of attacks that take upwards of 5-8 seconds, that you absolutely CAN’T punish afterwards as the combo actually had another 2-3 hits if you stood near them.
- Enemies can and WILL use that “ONE” attack, again and again until you die.
- Quest progression is basically impossible to keep track of without a notepad handy as the game lacks a basic quest log.
- Progress feels like it resets at the mid-end game due to enemy attacks dealing exponentially more damage.
- Certain rewards in dungeons can be completely useless for your build (Thanks open world game design!).

This applies to the DLC as well, but cranked up to 20 as you’ll need to get your Scat-du blessing up to level 20 if you intend to have any fun with this DLC. Gotta love arbitrary difficulty tied directly to world exploration that gets hindered by said enemies blocking your exploration, but hey! Game design is hard.

Best way to play this game is to look up any “How to get OP fast” guide that just tells you where all the OP equipment is and just abuse the broken Ashes of War because, honestly, they’re better than most of the spells you get.",1763260504,1763260714,False,3,3,0.47298160195350647,True,False,False,Elden Ring

I've spent over 3,000 hours in ELDEN RING (1,100 on PC and 3,000 on Xbox) and somehow that number still doesn't capture what this world has meant to me. It feels strange to call it ""just a game"" when it has been a place I've lived in, grown inside escaped to, and returned to again and again. The Lands Between pulled me in slowly... and then refused to let me go - and I'm grateful for that.

When I first stepped into Limgrave, I didn't know that I was about to begin a journey that would become part of my life. But every river valley, every ruined chapel and whispering forest path offered something more then a challenge - it offered a feeling. 
A feeling of curiosity.
A feeling of fear.
A feeling of wonder.
And over time, that wonder turned into a deep connection.

A world that feels like home
There's something indescribable about a world that you can wander for thousands of hours and still be surprised by. Even now, after all that time, I'll stop on a cliff in Altus Plateau and catch a view I've somehow never seen before. Or I'll notice a piece of environmental storytelling that suddenly makes everything click. ELDEN RING is alive in a way most open worlds only pretend to be.

It's a world that listens.
It's a world that remembers.
And somehow, in a strange way, it's a world that cares - not by coddling you, but by pushing you to grow.

The Combat: A Dance I'll Never Master (But I Love Trying To)

I've fought certain bosses so many times they feel like old friends - the kind who still beat you senseless but cheer for you when you finally stand tall again. Nothing in gaming compares to the feeling of learning a boss's rhythm, of finding your own way to face them, of finally landing that finishing blow after a dozen or a hundred attempts.
With each new build I try Whether it is Strength or Dex Intelligence maybe Faith or Arcane, or some chaotic blend - the game transforms. The combat is a conversation between you and the world, and after 3,000 hours, I'm still learning new words in its language.

A Story Told in Whispers 

What amazes me is how FromSoftware trusts the player. The game never spoon-feeds you meaning, but gently nudges you toward discovery. Every item description, every ruined statue, every ghostly figure murmuring its final words adds another thread to a tapestry woven with tragedy, hope, ambition, and mystery.
Some games tell stories.
ELDEN RING invites you to uncover one.

Why I Can't Stop Playing:

People sometimes ask how I can spend 3,000 hours in one game. the truth is simple: 
Because it doesn't stop giving.
There's always another build to test, another boss to rematch, another hidden area to explore, another theory to dig into. The game grows with you. It challenges you in different ways depending on who you are when you return.
some days i go in for the thrill of battle.
Other days i wander for the peace of exploration.
And sometimes... I step into the Lands Between simply because it feels comforting, familiar - like sitting by a warm fire after a long day.

A Masterpiece I'll Carry With Me:

After 3,000 hours, one would think i'd be done. But I'm not. Not even close. There is no ""end"" for me here - just another path to walk, another weapon to master, another reason to fall in love with the game all over again.

ELDEN RING isn't just a masterpiece.
It's a part of my life now - a place where I've grown, struggled, triumphed, and found joy in ways I never expected. And I'll keep playing it for years to come.

Please Please Please, let ELDEN RING take you on your own journey though the piece of art that is ELDEN RING. Good luck Fellow Tarnished.",1763184481,1763184481,True,0,0,0.5,True,False,False,Elden Ring

The open world part can also be a good and a bad part during your playthrough, when you fail to beat a boss you can just go to a different boss or explore to level up, on the flip side you can easily miss an area just to uncover it way later when you're very overleveled. Be prepared to google a lot in regards to quests as it's easy to lock yourself out of certain endings and rewards, this is also my only critique on this game since it can get very confusing on what to do since most of the time the game doesn't tell you anthing.

Took me 98 hours for my first ever playthrough of the game, but it was in no sense complete, I am still somehow missing an achievement boss! I did a dex/bleed build with a couple of curved greatswords. The late game bosses really don't care about the level of my character. Lady Rot was the hardest boss in the game by a mile. Took me 114 attempts at her. That's the most I have spent, not even Demon of Hatred took that long for me. (shameless plug of me beating her - [url=https://youtu.be/-4glOR36oZw]Video link[/url] ) 

Technically, yes, there are some places where fps drops even after multiple patches, and I had 1 crash in 100 hours of gameplay. Fromsoft games are stuck at 60 fps at most, but this game and its vistas really deserve more imo.

First and foremost: 
It's a successful experiment of open world. Fromsoft have delivered a vast rich world with epic battles and vistas. They have made it fun to explore with most side paths rewarding you for your curiosity. Time and time again I followed a secluded path and was rewarded, which encouraged me to explore more. The sheer size of the world makes for an epic adventure. I was only disappointed on a handful of occasions when boss was reused that I remembered fighting distinctly. Reusing Godrick (a great rune bearer) as Godefroy did not work for me.

Secondly:
Dungeons. I think I would have tired of the open world eventually. it's an issue alot of open world games face, every area has the depth of a puddle because the map is as wide as a ocean. Lucky Fromsoft played to their strengths and strategically placed dungeons and legacy dungeons to vary the experience and craft dense interconnected challenging levels. It changes the pace so well and so exceptionally. Elden ring could have released with no open world all together with simple paths between these legacy dungeons and would still be an excellent game.

Thirdly:
Mechanics. Darks souls combat is here and better than it's ever been, weapons are bombastic and exciting, powerstance duelwielding. With the added option of Ashes of war expanding on weapon arts gives customisation you will constantly be tinkering with trying to make weapons your own. And that's to say nothing of magic and miracles which are powerful beyond anything in previous games. The addition of jumping and designing maps around that mechanic is scary and complex but they pull it off. The legacy of Sekiro learned verticality plays so well and adds depth to exploration decisions and combat.

Pedantic notes:
Mounts 😈 I think if I had one desire it would be to remove Torrent and shave a third off the map size. I spent most of my playthough coop in the open world with a friend and so experienced most of the map without torrent, running very far in many open stretches of land with not much in it. In general I've not got much love for mounts as they feel like a design fix for worlds designed too large. I'd argue if you were to design Elden rings map without Torrent in mind, you could get more interesting experiences out of it. I would much rather see mobility in the form of magics, miracles, or equipment that teleports, transforms, or speeds up the player character.

The DLC:
Worse than the base game in all honesty. The map was far too large with really not enough in it. Many times I explored corners of the map fully only to not be rewarded or find anything of interest, really killing my curiosity (e.g. Cerulean fields of f*** all). There were also alot of strange parkour sections with torrent which felt like some of the worse paths in the game (the climb up to Bayle could have been so much more interesting on foot with a mountain legacy dungeon and I really didn't feel excited killing my 6th dragon in a row). Though the enemies are damn challenging, and it makes it worthwhile to think on your build, weapon, and who you're fighting to get an edge and the bosses are exceptional.
It's still fun and worth playing as everything else is spectacular, but a step backwards in open world design it feels like.

I enjoyed the game immensely (~230 hours for completed first playthough, though I did invade alot).

Story 5/10, you have to work to know what the heck is going on. Most of the story is hidden in obscure places, item descriptions, and notes to be pieced together, though that's not out of place for ""souls"" games. What story there is can be quite interesting, but you're better off having a YouTuber who studied this like it was their doctorate explain it to you.

Gameplay: 8/10, if you like this style of brutal, unforgiving combat where timing and knowing your weapon and foe is everything, you're in the right place. Sometimes you get hit when it really feels like you shouldn't have and some encounters are infuriating, but that's par for the course for this type of game. Many of the weapons and spells are very satisfying to use.

Sound: 9/10. Pretty thematic music, haunting but beautiful. Fits the world and scenery really well, though no particular tracks ever really stood out to me. General sound effects were what they needed to be.

Difficulty: it's a souls game. You're gonna have a steep learning curve, especially if you go in blind. With a detailed guide the game gets much less infuriating, and in some ways can even get too easy if you know how to min/max everything. In many ways the difficulty is all up to what a player wants it to be. Want it easy? There's ways to do that. Want it excruciatingly difficult? There's no end to challenge runs you can set up.

208932194,76561198079640270,9195,9195,1811,1762833875,"My first Souls game. Very highly recommended.

The positives:
 - Exploration, story, and open world design is an absolute master class in ""show don't tell"". There are so many secrets to find. It's so rewarding just to check every corner of the map and leave no stone unturned. 
- The combat and character customization rewards different play-styles and experimentation.
- The horse. I love that as soon as you whistle, it spawns immediately and you are already mounted. Riding around slashing enemies is fun. 
 - Feeling like a genetically hyper-optimized supremium alpha warrior after defeating bosses. 
 - I also really appreciate the small file size (for a modern AAA game) and the performance. It's very common nowadays for minimum specs to require a supercomputer, 160GB of space, and DLSS or FSR just to maybe hit 60fps. 

My nitpicks:
 - The lock-on can be frustrating and will often snap onto weak minor enemies instead of the extremely terrifying giant running towards you. It will also fail to lock on if an enemy is only slightly obscured by a wall or a tree or a column, and is charging up an attack that will invariably hit you through those trees, walls, and columns. 
 - The lock-on button is also the same as the recenter camera button, meaning attempted lock-ons while strafing will often snap the camera away from the enemy and leave you blind and open for damage.
 - The camera also has a tough time capturing some of the massive bosses. So you'll be unable to see or react to attacks and telegraphs. 
 - The upgrading resources could use adjectives instead of numbers to help differentiate them. I didn't realize Smithing Stone [4] is not the same thing as 4 Smithing Stones. It would be better if they were instead categorized on a scale from ""very weak"" to ""very strong"".
 - The music is also pretty forgettable. A few of the themes sound like they were thrown together with Kontakt in a day. Kind of baffling considering there are 7 composers credited.",1762834590,1762834590,True,0,0,0.5,True,False,False,Elden Ring

Open world is barren and a damn drag, just an overly long ds level with too much dead air. If the game actually had Sekiro's parry/reflect mechanic not locked behind a paywall and was just part of the damn base game I'd be more forgiving but there's nothing here of note. It's a shame because I was one of the biggest hype men back when they announced it but lost all interest when open world was announced. This wasn't made with any love or soul it's just the safest cash grab that capitalized on what was popular at the time. This isn't the only account I've played this game on.

The game is difficult and arguably unfair but not impossible.

Elden Ring is a masterful demonstration of From Software's formula crafted into the open world. Although, this game is no masterpiece, like any other game, it holds its own significant flaws. To call it a masterpiece detracts from its problems, giving its developers the illusion that they need not make improvements. It is regressive to consider any game perfect but I dare say Elden Ring approaches perfection. However, the game does suffer from major problems. 

The multiplayer component is lackluster. The implementation of limiting gameplay with friends is a mistake. Ideally, cooperative gameplay should be seamless in the exploration of this beautiful world, without the loops and hurdles required to do so. And yes, there is a great mod for that but modders are not responsible for fixing your bad implementation (I'm looking at you Bethesda). 

The weapon upgrade system has confusing dynamics. Often times upgrading base weapons with several smithing stones, in several tiers, is more challenging than upgrading unique weapons with somber smithing stones. Upgrading base weapons takes a total of 12 smithing stones per tier compared to the 1 somber smithing stone for unique weapons. Finding and grinding smithing stones can be its own difficulty, made even easier for unique weapons considering you only need 1. The system is backwards in my opinion and should be reversed. Simply put, the base weapons should be easier to upgrade than the unique ones. 

The most gigantic issue I have with this games design is its restrained style story telling. Giving the player little instruction creates a magnificently quiet atmosphere, unlike any other game, but it's not without trade-offs. While the quite can be breathtaking, it leaves so much to be desired for quest lines. Most of the time you'll find yourself using external resources for quest progression, item locations, weapon locations, etc. While some of those features are fine, its disastrous for story telling. You are nigh-on forced to look up quest progression beyond blind luck which has the effect of utterly ripping you out the experience. You'll be sooner be checking off a guided list of instructions on a YouTube guide or Wiki page than naturally progression the story. The problem is compounded when you need to complete these vague quest lines for different ending. While solutions are something I cannot easily provide, From should look to compromising between the baby mode of Rockstar missions and the quiet restraint that From is known for. 

Overall, disagree with my points as you like, but we need to be more critical of games. It's easily to clown on utter failures, but its far worse to relentlessly praise a great game. We cannot give From Software the idea that they are infallible. It's happened before, and now look at Bethesda's output. We should recognize and voice our issues without strictly praising a great game. Consequently, From Software will continue to improve and we will continue to play their great games. I don't want to continue in a market suffocated by underachievement and disappointment. A market that From Software has stood above, time and time again.",1762710817,1762711430,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,True,False,False,Elden Ring

Content wise this game needs more base weapons and more armor that changes stats and how the game is meant to be played with various special effects

Combat the game well it should've looked like elden ring reforged off rip lets be honest elden ring please hire the people who made that mod because they would be a good addition to your development team

Please keep working on this game stop making more random games with just different graphics

Add more DLC's and add some base content for people who cant afford to pay for it because I know alot of younger people then me dont have money laying around

Modding -> a great thing to keep your game going but modders are also a gateway to show you where your game needs to be improved and quality of life and general performance and quality improvements are always welcome

208597674,76561197981820812,5183,5183,55,1762472609,"It really is superb. The combat system is great, the customisation and control you have over your character is like nothing else I've played. The visual design is incredible and the world is so enjoyable to play in. The bosses look great and are mostly very fun to fight.

I deliberately went in as blind as possible. I knew everyone said this game was something else and I'd only played and completed Wukong as a similar game to this. The first 10-20 hours of me figuring out little bits at a time that improved my ability to play was so satisfying. I love the upgrade system and the flasks, the way the wondrous physick works is really good and can change your approach to a boss so quickly without loads of thought or time. 

With me going in blind, I didn't really experiment with summons, incantations, spells and crafting. I wouldn't do this again and I'd recommend new players try to figure this out early and maybe even restart with a new character once you've got the hang of it. The game doesn't hold your hand and I think some of this stuff would be best looked up online rather than just trying to brute force your way through the game. That said, I'm looking forward to playing through again some time and taking much more advantage of this the next time round. 



There are some issues with the game from my perspective. Some of the boss mechanics are extremely frustrating and it can take so long to get to that point of the fight after you die that it can be really hard to learn the tells or timing. Wukong had some bosses (not all) that you would just start on phase 2 if you got that far previously and I liked that. Long runs back to bosses weren't that common but that was pretty frustrating, also being subjected to cut scenes every time that you had to skip was frustrating. It would be good if you had a setting that could turn that off after the first attempt.

Fighting large bosses was quite often a pain from a camera perspective, and while not staying perma-locked on does help it's really a scale issue. You really need a second right thumb to do everything you need in a timely fashion.

I also found the critical hits inconsistent to land. Most of the time it's not a major issue but I didn't feel like I was the problem there.


I will 100% play through this again and I'm looking forward to focusing on the bits of the game that I realised much later I'd missed out, rather than going back and doing them overleveled. It was a great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone that hasn't played this type of game before, they just have to be willing to commit some time to getting over that early learning curve.",1762478316,1762478716,True,0,0,0.5,True,False,False,Elden Ring

If you like this, you don't know how game balance, or game design.
I have hundreds of hours in this game. I have thousands in DS3. Im a souls vet. this game is utter fucking trash garbage.

I literally have died to one boss this entire playthrough, and only because the shockwave of his hit, and a spell from a distance is enough to kill me from full health. I'm not some filthy cleric who doesn't know what he is talking about. I was literally talking to my friend about the enemy, and he didn't believe it was as bad as i was describing. He watched 10 seconds of the fight, and asked if I was fighting a boss, with how little damage I was doing, vs how much it was doing, along with the constant AOE attacks, and fast movement.

He didn't even get to see the part that i was saying makes it broken: the inability to punish them for healing, they can heal in between incantations, and don't stagger from a bow. Meaning they are effectively invincible if you can't one shot them, or two shot them, if you win the 50/50 and they don't hit you with an attack, instead going for a heal.

So... youre telling me i have to completely change my build up just to fight one enemy in the middle of a castle, just to have a chance to beat them? and even then, it's not guaranteed, because the big weapon will be slow... unless you use something like the zweihander, and crouch rb, or something along those lines.... like, youre telling me that is NOT bad game design in a game that let's you, and even rewards, for dumping into str/dex/faith/int/arc for better damage?

The boss fights of Elden Ring are excellent — the game manages to transmit very well the tension passed by the boss and also manages to transmit the difficulty of facing it kk.

Zerei Elden Ring on PS5 about three times and now I'm going to zero on PC again.

Their are so many more options to play the game then Code Vein... not dissing Code Vein i love the game and am planning my second playthrough and will always have a special place in my heart as my first souls game... but Elden Ring just has more options with ranged magic that is actually affective ( i dont know how either effective either is cause i have decided to do melee only) and summons.  Now the summons (Though i have not really tested it yet) does not seem to be as effective as your partner in Code Vein it is still an option... an option i have decided not to use... but an option.
